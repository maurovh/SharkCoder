# SharkCoder

SharkCoder is a quiz app with two mini-games designed to add some fun while you test your coding knowledge with a variety of
questions from different programming topics.
This app was developed in 24 hours by a team of four (me and three other colleages) during the final hackathon at our bootcamp
of full-stack developers at Academia de Código.

## Features

- Quiz: Test your coding knowledge with a variety of questions from different programming topics.
- Mini-Game 1: Do not let the watter get to the top of your screen, otherwise you will lose the game and close the quiz.
- Mini-Game 2: Swim fast and run away from the Shark God until you reach your life preserver.
